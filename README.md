## 📁 Folder Structure

**Explanation of Key Directories and Files:**

* **`models/`**: This directory contains the data models defined using Mongoose.
    * **`Job.js`**: Defines the schema for job objects, specifying the structure and data types of job listings in the database.

* **`node_modules/`**: This directory is automatically generated by npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn and contains all the project's dependencies (third-party libraries and packages). You typically don't manually modify the contents of this folder.

* **`public/`**: This directory holds all the static assets that are served directly to the client-side (browser).
    * **`css/`**: Contains the Cascading Style Sheets for styling the frontend.
        * **`style.css`**: The main stylesheet for the application's visual presentation.
    * **`js/`**: Contains the JavaScript files for client-side logic and interactivity.
        * **`script.js`**: JavaScript code that enhances the functionality and behavior of the `index.html` (homepage).
        * **`applied_script.js`**: JavaScript code specific to the `applied.html` (applications page).
    * **`index.html`**: The main homepage of the job finder application.
    * **`applied.html`**: The page where users can view their submitted job applications.

* **`routes/`**: This directory contains the route handlers for the application's API endpoints.
    * **`jobs.js`**: Defines the routes specifically related to job operations (e.g., fetching job listings, creating new jobs). These routes likely interact with the `Job` model.

* **`.env`**: This file stores environment-specific configuration variables, such as database connection strings, API keys, and port numbers. It's crucial to keep this file private and not commit it to version control.

* **`package.json`**: This file is the heart of any Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project (name, version, author, etc.), lists the project's dependencies and development dependencies, and defines scripts for common tasks (e.g., starting the server, running tests).

* **`package-lock.json`**: This file is automatically generated by npm and records the exact versions of all dependencies and their transitive dependencies. This ensures consistent installations across different environments.

* **`seed.js`**: This script is likely used to populate the database with initial or dummy data for development and testing purposes.

* **`server.js`**: This is the main entry point of the Node.js application. It typically sets up the Express server, connects to the database, mounts the routes, and starts listening for incoming requests.

This structure provides a clear separation between the frontend (in `public/`), the backend logic (in `routes/` and `models/`), and the server setup (`server.js`). This makes the codebase more organized, maintainable, and easier to understand.
